It is a text analysis tool, however it does not allow you to input your own text, and is instead testing you on how well YOU can analyze the text.
It will mark you on what you analyzed correctly, as well as explain problematic interpretations you may have made. For some of the harder poems it will provide additional
resources to further explain the use and significance of how the poem was written.
