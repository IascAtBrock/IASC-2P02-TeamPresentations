# Drucker Reading
## Drucker's Principles
### “humanities are committed to the concept of knowledge as interpretation”
### “the apprehension of the phenomena of the physical, social, cultural world is through constructed and constitutive acts, not mechanistic or naturalistic realist representations of pre-existing or self-evident information.” (Drucker para. 7)
### Analyze through Drucker lens how well 4B4V meets these expectations
#### The website works in absolutes, especially based on its marking scheme.  Drucker argues that visual tools that display data such as graphs and charts should allow for a more interpretive approach.  Seeing as the site uses the green, yellow, and red marks to tell us indefinitely whether we are scanning the poem correctly according to structure, it doesn’t leave much open to interpretation on its own platform.  The closest we get is the yellow mark, which works to explain that what we were interpreting may be problematic but not entirely wrong.  It allows us to better understand the source material it works with, that is undeniable, however it doesn’t leave much open to interpretation, as it is just simply a tool used to test scansion abilities.

## Moretti
### Perhaps mention how we weere going to use the Moretti reading to analyze poems and how they change over time, but the tool wasn't really set up for that, especially because it doesn't display the poems in chronological order

## The MP3 Theory
### Talk about Tom's Diner and how the interpretation of how it sounds through a specific MP3 algorithm influences how we listen to MP3's today
### Analyze how 4B4V is similar to this discussion, in the sense that it employs one specific sort of literature-based socio-historical lens and casts it onto every poem in its repertoire.  In this sense, it transforms our view of each poem on the site by influencing our views through this “proper scansion” testing process.  Obviously this is so we can best understand the poems in their historical period, therefore deriving the original meanings and themes behind them.
