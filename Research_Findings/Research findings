Speakers notes

An interactive map that allow users to coherently visualize and compare large amount of data in a quick grasp. 
In our case we analyzed the relationship between natural disasters and death toll
There are Limitations to this tool 

This tool is has a clean and organized interface and its helpful for visualizing the bigger picture when comes to handling large amount of data but 
Hard to understand all of this tools features and pinpoint all your data point as the proper data types, take some time to learn 
Palladio is not the most efficient because user would have to manually set every data point to the proper data type 
And the more data point you have the easier is it to make mistakes
