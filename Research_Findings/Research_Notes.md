## Use of Resource
### The best we can do is provide screenshots or a walkthrough of the tool itself (whether that be prerecorded or live)
### Must show engagement with the tool itself, we should all know how the tool works, which will be explained in part one and elaborated upon here
## Multimodal Arguments
### The tool itself doesn't particularly allow for any strong use of multimodality. It simply acts as a text analysis tool.
### Seeing as it's more of a tool for testing knowledge, it is restrictive in the sense that it doesn't allow us to manipulate research and create our own theories on how the poetry can be interpreted, and is instead rigid in how the poems are interpreted.
*We could use this point to argue in our theoretical discussion that the tool isn't particularly helpful to digital humanists according to the rules laid out by Drucker, as it provides rigid data as opposed to capta, in an attempt to restrict the interpretation of poetry at the time*
## Usability of the  tool
### In my opinion, I don't think it could be used to conduct meaningful research for future courses, just because of the restrictive nature of the tool itself.  I think there are better tools out there that on top of probably having a more accessible design, will also provide a better workspace for research for future courses.
### I would also take a look at how the tools are implemented into the website.  For example, it isn't very helpful that the buttons for checking your work don't actually tell you specifically what's wrong, and instead just flash a red or yellow light saying *something* is wrong.
