- Palladio provides an interactive map that allows users to coherently visualize the relationship between any two dimensions of data.
- Limitations of this tool?
- Overall usability
  - Clean and organized interface
  - Effective and powerful tool for visualizing different types of data
  - Hard to understand all itâ€™s features and lacks an effective tutorial
  - Low efficiency caused by having user manually set every data point 
  - Prone to errors due to the many variables in play for the tool to accurately pinpoint different data points onto the map

Speakers notes

An interactive map that allow users to coherently visualize and compare large amount of data in a quick grasp. 
In our case we analyzed the relationship between natural disasters and death toll

With palladio User are able to switch between different views like Map, Graph, Table, and Gallery to sort and visualize their data according to different dimensions.

For example: would use Map view when needed to compare any coordinates data as data points on a map. 
Data points on the map can be sized to represent their relative magnitude within their data.
nodes in Graph view can be scaled to reflect their relative magnitude just like in map view, except it's not on a map
In Table view, data can be arranged to make customized lists
In the Gallery view, data can be displayed within a grid setting for quick reference, data can also be linked to outside web-based information 


There are Limitations to this tool 

This tool is has a clean and organized interface and its helpful for visualizing the bigger picture when comes to handling large amount of data but 
Hard to understand all of this tools features and pinpoint all your data point as the proper data types, take some time to learn Palladio is not the most efficient because user would have to manually set every data point to the proper data type 
And the more data point you have the easier is it to make mistakes 

Future use of Palladio?
