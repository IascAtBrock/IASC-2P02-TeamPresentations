While exploring PRISm in a more in-depth and focused manner throughout the duration of this project I came to the realization that it was much more than a simple text highlighting tool, which was the impression that I had of it last year.  I found that It was very insightful especially in cases where the highlights meant different things, for example while using the PRISM tool on one of our reading I realized that this tool could be used in several different applications both from a DH perspective but also from a more holistic general humanities approach. As we discussed with the Drucker reading Data can be confusing and biased, this is just a given, similar to the reading when data is confusing it becomes inaccessible. PRISM however can be used to make this data understandable, by implementing PRISM as a regular  tool for classroom use, professors are allowing their students to work together to understand the readings as well as give the professor areas that they really need to focus on in class discussions. The theoretical, however comes in when exploring the possible uses of PRISM in higher more advanced settings, for example in a masters or PHD program, one could use the PRISM tool as a method for research analysis, by using PRISMS highlighting capabilities a student could easily track understanding or difficulties of the target demographic and use that to build a targeted and intuitive research question or paper.
