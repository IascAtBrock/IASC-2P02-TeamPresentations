It is very easy to create your own PRISM. After you create an email, you just input all your text and information into 
the text boxes then create. This is very useful for to get your friends or others perspective on a text and see how your 
thoughts and opinions may differ. Especially because everyone interprets things in different ways, this tool is very effective 
in an education and scholarly approach. I give this a 10/10 rating for its ease of use, I had no problems during the creation 
of my PRISM. It is also very fast and little to no overhead, I think anyone can use this at any level. 

After making my own PRISM, I decided to do another test, so I had my sister who’s in grade 7 test it out. I just showed her 
the website and gave her little information.
